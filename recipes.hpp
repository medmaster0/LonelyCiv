//Recipes and Resources
//
//These are more of a story element *attached* to the Item sprites
//
//* We give magical names to specific colors of items -
//  e.g. rgb(244,32,45) stones are made of "fofium hydoxide" and can be made into Qyrex glass
//
//* We also need to be able to combine these primitive named RESOURCES into more elaborate RECIPES.
//  e.g. Recipe for the Potion of Wisconsin Darkening of the Light, made of "kexonine" and in a "Qyrex" vial
//
// Types of Recipes and Resources will need a new coding system SEPARATE from the Item coding system...
// These Recipes and Resources will be integrated into each other, therefore...
// RECIPES and RESOURCES share the same coding table
